Often, people who oppose copyright give weak excuses as for how a market would
sustain artists creating work, without the government creating an artificial
monopoly on said work. In a recent conversation with one of my friends who
also oppose many aspects of the current copyright system, we brainstormed
alternatives. I opposed the traditional donation model as it's highly subject
to [free-rider problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-rider_problem),
and demanded that a new model be created[^1], if we should reasonably expect to
convince people to oppose copyright.

I used the example of Paper Lily, a free game on Steam, while I enjoyed the
game, the fact that it was free meant that future developement is mostly a
hobby project for the developers. You can "purchase" the game, as a donation,
but doing so is a highly voluntary transaction that wouldn't even directly
fund the creation of the next installment of the series. Even worse, as a
proxy for owners on steam, the free version has ~7.000 reviews while the paid
donation only has ~100. If only a hundred people donate, why would I choose
to pay? The total donations would only reach into the hundreds of Euros.

We then devised a new donation system, one in which your donation directly
supports the next installment of a series, a **Lasso Transaction**. The idea
is that the artist creates a smart-contract, a form of _piggy bank_. Anyone
can transfer funds into the piggy bank, but with one clear difference, with
the transaction you supply an expiration date. This expiration date would
represent when you would get your money back if the artist does not provide
a product and liquidate the assets stored in the piggy bank before the
specified expiration date.

This would naturally create an incentive for the artist to create the game in
a reasonable time frame, and it would also further incentivise donations. If
I get my money back anyways because no future installment in the series is
created, then I would be much less hesitant to put money on the line. This
also solves one of the issues I've had with the current copyright system,
in that it highly incentivises rent-seeking, since it's all about creating
a single work that can generate revenue, potentially for decades. With
Lasso Transactions only the creation of new content is subsiduized, while
the art created can then be freely distributed. This could even be done in
increments for Early Access games, creating Lasso Transaction based piggy
banks for each major update. Traditional kickstarter-like in-game rewards
or public recognition could still be given to depositors.

![Two graphs shoing earnings using Lasso Transactions, the longer the
creator waits with product delivery, the less they earn. The in the left
model depositors are more trusting and lenient, in the right model they
are more impatient leading to skewed expirations. In both graphs the
smart-contract is set up such that the minimum expiration date for the
project is 6 months](./lasso-earnings.png)

In the simplest model, if creators do not deliver, their reputation is simply
tarnished, and future piggy banks will be left mostly empty as people would
be much less willing to fund a grifter. Alternatively, depositors can veto
the creator withdrawal, if some quorum of depositors vote to do so.

Youtubers can create piggy banks per video and musicians can create piggy
banks per song or album. Movies could even be funded under the same scheme
if this model works well enough or the movie is cheap enough. If it's a
larger project, the creator of the piggy bank can take out loans since the
piggy bank holder can show investors a time-line for what the return on
investment will be given some delivery date.

But why stop there? Optimistically, they could be applied to a bigger
scale. Lego is located in Billund, with no train-lines connected to the
second-largest city in Denmark, Aarhus. Many workers would benefit from such
a line, and might even be willing to donate in order for it to be built. Lego
itself may be willing to donate large sums as it directly makes it easier to
supply labour to the company. Lego could even additionally match individual
donations to increase their impact. The government then just needs to foot
the rest of the bill themselves, out of their own interest in developoing
the economy.

All-in-all, I think Lasso Transactions serve as an interesting mitigation
to the free-rider problem. The core benefits of Lasso Transactions are:

- **Incentive Alignment:**
  By tying donations to a smart contract with an expiration date, a low-risk
  environment for supporters is created. The refund mechanism reduces the
  hesitation to contribute, as depositors are protected if the creator fails to
  deliver. And creators are incentivized to produce work within a reasonable
  timeframe to access the funds, avoiding the stagnation that can occur with
  traditional donation models.
- **Encouraging Ongoing Creation:**
  Unlike copyright, which can incentivize rent-seeking on a single work,
  Lasso Transactions focus on subsidizing new content. This could foster a
  culture of continuous innovation and creativity, as creators are rewarded
  for producing rather than resting on past successes. The incremental model
  allows for iterative funding, which aligns well with modern development
  cycles in certain creative industries.
- **Transparency and Trust:**
  Smart contracts provide a transparent, tamper-proof system for managing
  funds. depositors can trust that their money will either support the project,
  be returned, or facilitate the destruction of creating party's reputation.
- **Market-Driven Accountability:**
  The expiration date creates a natural deadline, holding creators accountable
  without relying on centralized enforcement.
