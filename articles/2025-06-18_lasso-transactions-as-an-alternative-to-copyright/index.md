Often, people who oppose copyright give weak excuses as for how a market
would sustain artists creating work. In a recent conversation with one of my
friends who oppose copyright we brainstormed how this problem could be
solved. I opposed the traditional donation model as it's subject to Tragedy
of the Commons, and demanded that a new model be created.

I used the example of Paper Lily, a free game on Steam, while I enjoyed the
game, the fact that it was free meant that future developement is mostly a
hobby project for the developers. You can "purchase" the game, as a donation,
but doing so is a highly voluntary transaction that wouldn't even directly
fund the creation of the next installment of the series. Even worse, as a
proxy for players, the free version has ~7000 reviews while the paid donation
only has ~100. If only a hundred people donate, why would I choose to pay? The
total donations would only reach into the hundreds of Euros.

We then devised a new donation system, one in which your donation directly
supports the next installment of the franchise, a **Lasso Transaction**. The
idea is that the artist creates a smart-contract, a form of Piggy Bank. Anyone
can transfer funds into the Piggy Bank, but with one clear difference,
with the transaction you supply an expiration date. This expiration date
would represent the date where you get your money back if the artist does
not provide a product and liquidate the assets stored in the piggy bank
before that date.

This would naturally create an incentive for the artist to create the game in
a reasonable time frame, and it would also further incentivise donations. If
I get my money back anyways because no future installment in the series is
created, then I would be much less hesitant to put money on the line. This
also solves one of the issues I've had with the current copyright system,
in that it highly incentivises rent-seeking, since it's all about creating
a single work that can generate revenue, potentially for decades. With
Lasso Transactions only the creation of new content is subsiduized, while
the art created can then be freely distributed. This could even be done in
increments for Early Access games creating Lasso Transaction based piggy
banks for each major update. Traditional kickstarter-like in-game rewards
or public recognition could still be given to donors.

Youtubers can create piggy banks per video and musicians can create piggy
banks per song or album. Movies could even be funded under the same scheme
if this model works well enough or the movie is cheap enough. If it's a
larger project, the creator of the piggy bank can take out loans since the
piggy bank holder can show investors a time-line for what the return on
investment will be given some time-frame.

But why stop there? Lego is located in Billund, with no train-lines connected
to the second-largest city in Denmark, Aarhus. Many workers would benefit
by such a line, and might even be willing to donate in order for it to
be built. Lego itself may be willing to donate large sums as it directly
makes it easier to supply labour to the company. The government then, just
needs to foot the rest of the bill themselves, out of their own interest in
developoing the economy.

All-in-all, I think Lasso Transactions serve as an interesting mitigation
to the tragedy of the commons.
